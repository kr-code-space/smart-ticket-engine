## Security Best Practices

### Before Production:
1. Change ALL default passwords immediately
2. Use strong passwords (minimum 12 characters)
3. Include: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
4. Never use the same password across accounts
5. Store production passwords in a password manager

### Password Requirements:
- Minimum length: 12 characters
- Must contain: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, special characters
- No common words or patterns
- Unique per account

### How to Change Passwords:
1. Delete `admins.csv` file
2. Edit passwords in `server.py` lines 58-63
3. Restart the server
4. New `admins.csv` will be created with updated hashes

## Notes

- Passwords are stored as SHA-256 hashes in `admins.csv`
- Original passwords cannot be recovered from hashes
- Session management uses secure random keys
- All admin actions are logged in `admin_activity_log.csv`
